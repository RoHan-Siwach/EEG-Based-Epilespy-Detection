# EEG-Based-Epilespy-Detection
This project uses EEG data to detect epileptic seizures with machine learning models, focusing on CNN and RNN architectures. It includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation, leveraging Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and scikit-learn for implementation. The aim is to enhance seizure prediction through neural network-based analysis.
